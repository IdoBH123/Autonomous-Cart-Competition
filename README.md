# Autonomous-Cart-Competition

## Overview
This project focuses on designing and implementing an autonomous cart using the Arduino programming language. The cart competes by navigating towards an IR signal transmitted from the edge of a room, aiming to reach the transmitter quickly while avoiding obstacles.

## Features
- IR Signal Processing: The cart uses IR receivers to detect a modulated signal, guiding it towards the transmitter with high accuracy.
- Drive System: Powered by four DC motors, the cart is built for speed and stability, adapting to varying conditions.
- Obstacle Avoidance: Equipped with sensors, the cart detects and avoids obstacles in real-time to ensure smooth navigation.

## Testing & Integration
Each subsystem—transmission, reception, propulsion, and obstacle avoidance—was rigorously tested. After individual testing, systems were integrated and optimized for peak performance.
